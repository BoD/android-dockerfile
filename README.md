# android-dockerfile

A very simple Dockerfile with the Android tools.

An equivalent script for Amazon ec2 (Amazon Linux 2) is also available [here](ec2-android-sdk-setup.sh) and can be used this way:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoD/android-dockerfile/master/ec2-android-sdk-setup.sh)"
```
